# Meditation in Agony

The door kept banging and my ears hurt. I remember screaming through the chaos. I remember knives slicing against metallic door locks. I remember violent threats.

There was a lake. Deep into the winters, a thin sheet of ice lay over its top. Coniferous forests covered in white surrounded it, enclosing it in a protective sphere. 

The guns wouldn't stop. They just wouldn't. The bullets never ended. The sky blazed in the fire of dying souls and corpses of martyrs. Eyes teared up to the smoky haven. 

Nothing moved, nothing talked remained just at they were. A drop of rain fell on the smooth rock and glided to its side. More fell and glided. And soon they were one. 

One, two, three, four, dogs lay over the sea shore. Dying and wailing, guts out bleeding. Five, six, seven, eight, sadistic laughs had used their bait.
