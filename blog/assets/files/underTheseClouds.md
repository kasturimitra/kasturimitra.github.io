# Under These Clouds

<div class = "date">10th May, 2019</div>

It’s been two days since the clouds and here you lie. In this forest, under its canopy, and under these clouds. Are they the same? You don’t know.

You stare upwards wondering how you got here. You decide that it doesn’t matter. In this moment that you are, it’s only you that exists, only you that are and nothing really matters. You get up and look around and find yourself moving towards the cave. You don’t know what lies inside but you know you have to. You feel that urge.

As you step inside, you feel a part of you missing. Something that was, but not anymore. You don’t feel hollow; you don’t feel empty. You don’t feel anything at all. You have to keep trotting forward. You know that, don’t you?

Five hundred steps later you see an exit. A glimmering light at the end of the tunnel. You can’t wait to step out. You can’t wait to see what’s beyond. But you don’t feel excited. You don’t feel anything at all, do you?

The world outside is everything you imagined. It’s hard to describe because it’s tailored for you; you are the sole reason this world exists. Perhaps you’re the owner. But you don’t know, do you?

You walk around to find everything in the most perfect state that they can be. Again, it’s perfect, but for you. The people you meet and the foods you eat and the places you see – everything is here for you. No, everything is here because of you. Or so you think. You don’t know though, do you?

Repetition is a concept from far away, and you get short glimpses of what that used to be like. In your new house, you have everything as you ever wanted. Nothing’s ever been better, you conclude from what is left of your memory.

You spend days, months, maybe even years; it’s hard to know. Time is an abstract concept and you don’t remember the last time you held a watch. Nobody here bothers with the frivolities of an end and a beginning, and neither do you. But do you want to? You don’t know, do you?

You find yourself to be happy, you find yourself to enjoy. You can see the smile on your face every time you’re in front of the mirror. But you can’t feel it, can you? Not the emotion anyway. You’re never going to feel again, and you know that. You are you but you don’t feel like it’s you. Is it still really you? You don’t know though, do you?

The emptiness creeps in amidst all the perfection. You feel something wrong. You can’t explain because you haven’t felt in so long. And momentarily, you remember what duration feels like. You choose to look around, but you choose to look close, and for the first time, you see the flaws. And once you’ve seen, you can’t ignore. You know what you have to do, don’t you?

It takes a while for you to find the cave again, and once you do, you don’t look back. Five hundred steps out, something jolts back into you. You pause, completely stunned, fall to the stone cold floor and start crying. You’ve missed this. You’ve missed you. You’ve missed being you, and you’ve missed feeling what it’s like to be you.

When the tears finally stop, you find yourself in the familiar forest. You’re under its canopy and under these clouds. Are they the same? You don’t care.

Should you leave or should you stay? You already know that, don’t you?
