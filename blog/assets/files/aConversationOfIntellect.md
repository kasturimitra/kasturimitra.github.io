# A Conversation of Intellect

“Have you ever thought what’s in those books?”

“Books?”

“Yeah, those bundles of papers stuck together.”

“Oh. Well… not really.”

“Hmm.”

“Why though?”

“I saw this old bearded fellow the other day. It was near the Plaza. He was sitting and staring at one of those pages with intense concentration.”

“Such dedication.”

“Yeah, exactly. So it got me thinking: what was it that he was achieving from looking at a single page?”

“They call it reading, you know. Deciphering stuff from these pages. All those eerie lines, curved and straight, they call them letters.”

“Come on, I know that. I just don’t understand how they are beneficial. What do people get out of this so called art of ‘reading’?”

“Words. Words. I guess it’s just like stuff we speak. Just on paper.”

“So people read… conversations? Weird.”

“I’m just guessing. Because they can’t just stare at random words floating on a page, right?”

“Where do they get so much to put down on paper from? Maybe it’s the exact thing we’re talking about right now.”

“Don’t give me the creeps. Never liked them readers anyway. Snobs. All of them.”

“But this deciphering thing is still pretty cool, eh? Someone could read the same thing fifty years later. Whatever they have to.”

“But they say you need this thing called ‘intellect’ to learn this art.”

“Hey! Look at us. We’re talking about books. We do have this ‘intellect’ thing, okay.”

“This is so absurd. We’re talking like one of those laureates.”

“We shouldn’t. It’s blasphemous.”

“Yeah. Us and readers. Eeks. Our end is near.”

“Don’t see that happening. Not in a few thousand years at least.”

“Few million neither.”

“Anyway, I had to skip a few stones. I should get going.”

“Mind if I tag along?”

“Nope. As long as you’re not carrying a book.”
