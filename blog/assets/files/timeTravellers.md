# Time Travellers

Pause, look around. There is chaos. It's busy. All is happening at once. Shuffling of feet. Constant chattering. You're watching, you're observing, you might even be judging. But you're just an outsider; you can't contribute. You can learn, you can grow wise. You will grow old. But the fascination will diminish. A pattern will set in. You'll grow used to it. You'll laugh at the repetition, cry for the same mistakes. You'll try remembering the time it all began. Look around. You've travelled in time.
