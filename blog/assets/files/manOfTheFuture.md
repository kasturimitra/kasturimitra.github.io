#  Man of the Future

<div class = "date">27th November, 2018</div>

There was once a man who could see the future. In a Victorian village of the 1800s, he would predict the upcoming of electricity and of women voting. He would talk of metal cages with wheels going faster than any animal known. He would talk of the humongous castles shared by the common man that rose up yards into the sky. He would talk of times when people didn’t die of disease but sadness. Of times when people forgot even with memory devices in their palms. Of times when everything from now would be obsolete. And so he lived, waiting for the future to come, wasting his days scowling at the current state of the world. Day after day, year after year. He spent his entire life in contempt, only to realize he would never be alive to see his foreseen future. He had spent his entire life living in a time he didn’t belong. 

Amidst all his foretelling, he had forgotten to see his own future.
