# Oh My Paradoxical Twin

<div class="date">29th March, 2016</div>

I woke up in a room that wasn’t my own. Or a one that I had been to earlier. I could be dramatic saying that the sun rays were hitting my face, but there were none. It was night, clearly. The room was as dark it could get with the faint dull glow of the street lights outside.

Street lights. So I was in the middle of… somewhere. I needed to get up. So I did. I walked up to the only window and found myself staring down at a pile of dead bodies. No metaphors there. I almost puked at the site. Where was I?

I turned around and tried to remember how I got there. It was there in my head but as I thought about, and every subsequent time, my head throbbed.

Something here felt out of place. Something in this room didn’t quite fit in. Something was absurd. The door! There was no door. Then how in the world did I manage to get in here?

Okay, calm down, I told myself. It’ll be okay.

The only way of escape was the window. But the bodies. I puked in my mouth, for real this time, but swallowed it in fear this room could be my permanent abode. And well, puke stinks. So the window. I gathered enough courage to walk up to it.

My eyes were closed till now. But I managed to open them.

Horse carriages raced everywhere. Women walked in gowns with their arms around men wearing thick overcoats and suits. The glow on the street intensified at the newspaper stand where black and white print lay spawned across.

No.

I closed my eyes.

No.

Okay, I was most certainly dreaming, or I did drugs alone and this was one of the bad trips.

Taking a glance behind, I realized the door still hadn’t reappeared. Maybe it was ever there in the first place.

The window.

This time a forest. A one surrounded by a mountain range. Coniferous.

A city. Tall buildings. The view was at least from thirty floors above the ground.

A party. Disco lights. Constant flickering. Dancing. EDM.

A shipwreck. Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.

A frozen land. Lights in the night sky. Aurora. A faint music.

Me. In my bed. Typing something. A fantasy capable of never coming true. Within lay the last words I ever wrote. Within lay the last things I would experience.

Should I laugh?

I truly was the master of my own fate.
