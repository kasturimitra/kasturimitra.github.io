Dear Alex

It has been ten minutes since the sunset. The sky is a dark shade of blue with barely any clouds. It would get darker soon, so dark to barely be able to see anything at all.

Far along the shore I think there is a fisherman’s boat. It causes ripples along the calm sea. It feels a little like my mind, somewhat soothing.

I’ve always wanted to take a picture like this. Thirty four trips all my life, and never once have I seen something so beautiful. I wish I were a better writer. I don’t think I’m doing the scenery much justice. Had you been here, I wouldn’t’ve had to make so much effort, you know? You could’ve done the writing yourself.

As I lie, the dark sand pokes against my right cheek. My nose itches but I don’t scratch.

I could have done so much more, been so much more. I had so much to live for.

I can hear the faint hum of my car’s engine even from here. The cliff is some fifteen metres above, and on it is my car with the parking brakes on. Would somebody notice it?

I can feel tears streaming down. I am stuck here. There is nothing I can do. There is nowhere else I can be, and certainly not with you.

I laugh. This is my doing.

I can’t move any part of my body.
